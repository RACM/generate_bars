# generate_bars
This is a shell script that will create syntetic multicast or unicast stream for the pourpose of testing.
The shell script uses FFMPEG to generate the stream, therefore FFMPEG is a dependancy.
The output stream is CBR. There are options for Video resolution and Video encoders. Hardware acceleration is not yet supported.
Yes, you can do it yourself using FFMPEG, but it is nice to follow a CLI menu to manage all your streams.
